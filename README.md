# Atlas Team Rust Backend

The Neuradix Atlas Team backend: the always-on counterpart to the local-first
Flutter client. **Phase 2** provides identity (companies, users, memberships,
devices), the per-company **mutation-log sync** the client's `CloudAdapter`
contract expects, content-addressed **blob** storage for attachment bytes, raw
**webhook intake**, and a server-side **audit log**. **Phase 3** adds the
**posting authority**: backend-confirmed official document submission with
gap-free numbering, perpetual-inventory stock + COGS GL posting, reversals,
settlements and server-side immutability (see the Phase 3 section below).

Design references (in the `mercantis.hub.flutter` repo):

- `docs/ATLAS_SOLO_TEAM_BACKEND_DECISION.md` — why this backend exists, the stack
  (§5), the authority model (§6), the sync model (§7), identity/audit (§8).
- `docs/ROADMAP_V2_SOLO_TEAM.md` — §6 lists the acceptance criteria: the [P2]
  coordination items and the [P3] posting-authority items, both covered by the
  tables below.
- `docs/STOCK_COGS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — §2 target accounting behaviour,
  §4 Track B (this engine), §5 the shared fixture suite.

**Not in this service yet:** webhook verification/processing for providers
other than Stripe (their intake is log-only), POS session close, and the
client preview-vs-official flow (client-side work). Stripe payment webhooks
are verified and posted officially — see the Payments section.

## Architecture notes

- **Axum + Tokio + SQLx + PostgreSQL** (decision doc §5). All persistence sits
  behind an async `Store` trait (`src/store/mod.rs`) with two implementations:
  - `MemStore` — in-memory; used by the test suite and the `--mem` dev mode.
  - `PgStore` — SQLx/Postgres with runtime queries (no compile-time `query!`
    macros), so the project builds and tests **without any database**.
- The wire format of a mutation is the Dart client's `MutationRecord`
  (camelCase: `id, type, docType, documentId, payload, deviceId, userId,
  localTimestamp, syncVersion, status`). Sync versions are assigned
  server-side, monotonically increasing per company; `syncVersion` is returned
  as a string because the Dart field is `String?`.
- Bearer tokens (user tokens from bootstrap/invitation-accept, device tokens
  from device registration) are opaque random values; only SHA-256 hashes are
  stored. Every company-scoped route checks membership; roles gate sensitive
  routes server-side.
- Every state-changing authenticated endpoint writes an `audit_log` row
  (company, user, device, action, detail, timestamp). Webhook intake is itself
  the durable log (`webhook_events`).

## Running

### Dev mode, no database

```sh
cargo run -- --mem
curl localhost:8080/health   # {"status":"ok"}
```

State lives in memory and is lost on exit. `PORT` overrides the default 8080.

### Compose mode (Postgres 16)

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Brings up `postgres:16` (volume `pgdata`, healthchecked) and the backend
(migrations in `migrations/` are applied automatically on startup). Set
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in the environment or an `.env` file for anything
non-local. A Caddy TLS proxy stub is provided (`Caddyfile` + the commented
`caddy` service) for exposing the webhook endpoints publicly.

Running against an existing Postgres instead: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://... cargo run`.

### Backup / restore

```sh
scripts/backup.sh                     # pg_dump -> backups/atlas-<UTC stamp>.sql
scripts/restore.sh backups/atlas-....sql atlas_drill   # drill into a scratch DB
scripts/restore.sh backups/atlas-....sql               # restore the live DB
```

Both scripts run the tools inside the compose `postgres` service. Drill the
restore on a copy regularly — that is part of the acceptance criterion, not an
afterthought.

## API surface

All request/response bodies are JSON unless noted. Authenticated routes take
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; every `/companies/{id}/...` route requires the
caller to be a member of that company (403 otherwise; 401 when the token is
missing or unknown).

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | none | Liveness: `{"status":"ok"}` |
| POST | `/companies` | none (bootstrap) | `{name, owner_email, owner_name}` → company + owner + owner membership; returns a user token |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/invitations` | user/device token, **owner or admin** | `{email, role}` → `{token, expiresAt}` (7-day expiry) |
| POST | `/invitations/{token}/accept` | none (token is the credential) | `{display_name}` → creates/joins user + membership; returns a user token |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/devices` | user token | `{name}` → `{deviceId, deviceToken}` |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/sync/push` | **device token** | `{mutations: [MutationRecord…]}` → `{versions: {id: version}}`; idempotent on mutation id |
| GET | `/companies/{id}/sync/pull?after={v}` | **device token** | `{mutations: […]}` with `syncVersion` set, ordered by version; `after` omitted = from 0 |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/sync/ack` | **device token** | `{ids: […]}` → `{acknowledged: n}` |
| PUT | `/companies/{id}/blobs/{sha256}` | member | Raw bytes body; 201, or **422** if the body's SHA-256 ≠ path |
| GET / HEAD | `/companies/{id}/blobs/{sha256}` | member | Bytes / existence; 404 when absent |
| POST | `/webhooks/payments/{provider}` | none | Logs raw headers+body to `webhook_events` → `{"logged": true}`. `provider = stripe` routes to the signature-verified processor below instead |
| POST | `/webhooks/payments/stripe` | Stripe signature | Verified intake + official Payment Entry posting (Payments section) |
| POST | `/webhooks/channels/{connector}` | none (verification is later work) | Same log-only intake, `kind = channel` |
| GET | `/companies/{id}/audit?limit=n` | **owner, admin or accountant** | Recent audit rows (newest first) |
| GET / PUT | `/companies/{id}/settings` | member / **owner, admin or accountant** | Company posting settings (merge-patch): `allow_negative_stock`, `books_lock_date`, default posting accounts |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/items` | **owner, admin or stock** | Item-registry upsert: `{id, item_type, valuation_method, stock_uom, uoms: [{uom, conversion_factor}], *_account overrides}` |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/commands/submit-document` | **device token**, role per doctype | Official submission → `{document_id, number, docstatus, gl_entries, stock_ledger_entries, party_transactions, tax_transactions, bins, settlements}` |
| POST | `/companies/{id}/commands/cancel-document` | **device token**, role per doctype | Reversal batch (negated legs, `-reversal` ids), docstatus 2 |

Roles: `owner, admin, sales, purchasing, stock, pos, accountant, advisor`.
Command-role gates: Sales Invoice → sales/owner/admin · Purchase
Invoice/Receipt → purchasing/owner/admin · Delivery Note →
stock/sales/owner/admin · POS Invoice → pos/owner/admin · Stock Entry →
stock/owner/admin · Payment Entry → accountant/owner/admin (cancel requires
the same role as submit).

## ROADMAP_V2 §6 — [P2] acceptance criteria coverage

| # | Criterion ([P2]) | Endpoint(s) | Test (`tests/api.rs`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Owner can create a Team company | `POST /companies` | `bootstrap_creates_company_owner_and_token` |
| 2 | Owner can invite another user | `POST /companies/{id}/invitations` | `invitation_flow_lets_second_user_join_and_register_devices`, `only_owner_or_admin_can_invite` |
| 3 | Second user can join and register a device | `POST /invitations/{token}/accept`, `POST /companies/{id}/devices` | `invitation_flow_lets_second_user_join_and_register_devices`, `invitation_cannot_be_accepted_twice` |
| 4 | Two devices sync masters/drafts through the backend | `POST …/sync/push`, `GET …/sync/pull`, `POST …/sync/ack`, blob routes | `push_assigns_monotonic_versions_and_is_idempotent`, `pull_returns_camelcase_records_in_version_order`, `ack_marks_mutations_acknowledged`, `blob_put_get_head_roundtrip_and_hash_check` |
| 8 | Audit log records user, device, company, action, timestamp for every backend action | all mutating endpoints → `GET …/audit` | `every_mutating_action_writes_an_audit_row` |
| 9 | Roles restrict access server-side | role checks on invitations + audit; device-only sync | `only_owner_or_admin_can_invite`, `audit_feed_is_role_restricted`, `sync_requires_a_device_token`, `non_members_get_403` |
| 10 | Backup and restore are possible and drilled | `scripts/backup.sh`, `scripts/restore.sh` (documented drill) | n/a (operational scripts) |
| 12 | Payment link events can be received and logged | `POST /webhooks/payments/{provider}` | `webhooks_are_logged_without_auth` |
| 13 | Online store webhook events can be received and logged | `POST /webhooks/channels/{connector}` | `webhooks_are_logged_without_auth` |

## Phase 3 — backend-authoritative postings

Track B of `docs/STOCK_COGS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: the Rust engine is the
posting authority for Team companies, semantically ported from the Dart Solo
engine (`lib/ledger/ledger_derivation.dart`, `ledger_derivation_service.dart`,
`stock_costing.dart`, `stock_balance.dart`) — same deterministic row ids
(`GL-{id}-debit`, `SLE-{id}-{i}`, `{sleId}-gl-d`/`-gl-c`, `-reversal` suffix),
same moving-average/FIFO issue costing (FIFO shortfall falls back to moving
average), same perpetual-inventory GL mapping (sales issue → Dr COGS / Cr
Inventory at valuation cost; purchase receipt → Dr Inventory / Cr GRNI with the
Purchase Invoice's stock value split off the expense leg onto GRNI; stock-entry
movements → the stock-adjustment account; transfers value-neutral, no GL), same
return semantics (goods re-enter at the original voucher's issue cost).

Each command is **one atomic store transaction** (`Store::posting_commit`):
validate (per-doctype role, period lock via `books_lock_date`, JE-style balance
guard on the generated GL, negative-stock rejection unless
`allow_negative_stock`) → allocate the gap-free official number → insert
document + GL + SLE + settlements + posting batch → recompute the touched bins
→ write the audit row. Costing reads are protected by optimistic stock-ledger
expectations: if a concurrent commit moved a touched (item, warehouse) pair,
the commit fails `Stale` and the command recomputes. `idempotency_key` replays
return the originally committed response without posting again. Cancellation
mirrors the stored rows (reusing stored SLE rates — issues are never re-costed)
into a linked `PB-{id}-reversal` batch and sets docstatus 2. Official (posted)
documents are immutable on the sync plane: `sync/push` rejects any mutation
targeting them with 409.

Posted results also **replicate to client devices through the mutation log**:
the same atomic commit appends system-authored mutations (device id
`atlas-backend`, deterministic `postmut-…` ids, log-idempotent) for the
document (`submitDocument`/`cancelDocument`), every GL / stock ledger /
settlement row, every touched bin, and each referenced invoice's
outstanding-amount update — in the Dart sync engine's row-envelope wire shape
(`src/posting/replication.rs`), so a normal `GET …/sync/pull` delivers the
official state to every device (`tests/posting_replication.rs`).

### ROADMAP_V2 §6 — [P3] acceptance criteria coverage

| # | Criterion ([P3]) | Endpoint(s) | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Official document submission is backend-confirmed | `POST …/commands/submit-document`, `POST …/commands/cancel-document` | `tests/fixtures.rs` (all fixtures), `tests/posting.rs::commands_require_device_tokens_and_write_audit_rows` |
| 6 | Official numbers allocated safely (no duplicates/races; gap-free) | number allocation inside `posting_commit`; rejected submits burn no number | `tests/posting.rs::gap_free_numbering_under_20_concurrent_submits`, `…::idempotency_key_replay_returns_same_result_without_double_posting`, fixture `0006` |
| 7 | Submitted documents cannot be destructively edited | `sync/push` 409 guard; cancel-only state machine | `tests/posting.rs::submitted_documents_are_immutable_via_sync_push`, `…::cancel_requires_a_submitted_document_and_cannot_repeat` |
| 11 | Mandatory stock/COGS posting test passes on Rust | full command surface | `tests/fixtures.rs::fixture_0001_mandatory_perpetual_inventory` |

Phase 3 also extends criterion 8: every submit/cancel writes a
`command.submit-document` / `command.cancel-document` audit row (user + device
attributed) inside the same transaction as the posting.

### Shared fixture suite — one truth, two engines

`tests/fixtures/*.json` is the **language-neutral Dart ↔ Rust accounting
contract** (plan §5): each file is `{setup, actions, expect}`, driven here over
the command API + `MemStore` by `tests/fixtures.rs`. Fixture
`0001-mandatory-perpetual-inventory.json` is the mandatory acceptance scenario
verbatim; the Dart side runs the same scenario today as
`mercantis.hub.flutter/test/stock_cogs_acceptance_test.dart` (JSON-driving the
Dart engine from these files is future work). The rest: `0002` FIFO costing
incl. shortfall fallback, `0003` negative-stock rejection, `0004` adjustment
up/down, `0005` payment settlement + outstanding, `0006` period lock, `0007`
role rejection, `0008` value-neutral transfer.

### Customer / Supplier / Tax subledger rows

The engine emits the Dart derivation's subledger rows alongside GL + SLE +
Settlement, with the exact Dart ids, field names and negate-on-reversal
semantics (`ledger_derivation.dart`):

- **Customer Transaction** (`CT-{doc id}{-reversal}`) — Sales Invoice books
  `trans_type Invoice`, `amount = +grand_total` (positive = the customer owes
  us), plus `customer`, `posting_date`, `due_date`, voucher linkage and
  `is_reversal`; a Payment Entry (`payment_type Receive`) books
  `trans_type Payment`, `amount = −paid_amount`.
- **Supplier Transaction** (`VT-{doc id}{-reversal}` — the Dart id prefix is
  `VT-`, kept for row-for-row parity) — mirror semantics on Purchase Invoice
  (positive = we owe) and `payment_type Pay` payments.
- **Tax Transaction** (`TT-{doc id}-{i}{-reversal}`) — one per invoice `taxes`
  row (rides in the submit payload's `taxes` array, computed client-side like
  the Dart `TaxCalculationInterceptor` output): `tax_type`, `tax` (code),
  `base_amount` (taxable), `tax_amount`, `rate`, `party_type`/`party` and the
  voucher linkage. A zero-amount tax row posts no GL leg but still records its
  taxable base — the VAT return is built from this subledger alone.

Cancellation mirrors the stored rows: negated amounts, `-reversal` ids, and
the Dart cancel trans_types (`Invoice → CreditNote`, `Payment → Adjustment`).
The rows persist in their own tables (`0005_subledgers.sql`), ride in the
command response (`party_transactions`, `tax_transactions`) and **replicate
through the mutation log** as `Customer Transaction` / `Supplier Transaction`
/ `Tax Transaction` row envelopes, so client devices receive exactly the rows
the Dart derivation would have produced locally. Fixture
`0009-subledger-rows.json` pins the amounts; `tests/posting_replication.rs`
pins the wire envelopes.

### POS Invoice + Delivery Note

The command API's doctype surface covers the full Dart sale-side stock flow:

- **POS Invoice** (series `POS-`, role gate pos/owner/admin) — a cash sale
  with the Dart `_posInvoice` semantics: stock issue is always on (per-line
  `warehouse` or the document `set_warehouse`), Dr `cash_account` (gross) /
  Cr `income_account` (net of tax) + output-VAT legs and `TT-…` tax subledger
  rows. No receivable and no party subledger — payment is inline; the
  `tenders` child table never posts. Blank `cash_account`/`income_account`
  resolve from the company defaults.
- **Delivery Note** (series `DN-`, role gate stock/sales/owner/admin) — the
  pure stock-issue document (`_deliveryNote`): SLE at −qty costed by the
  item's valuation method plus the perpetual-inventory Dr COGS / Cr Inventory
  legs, and nothing else — no receivable, no income, no subledger rows.

Both cancel through the same exact-reversal path (stored rates reused,
`-reversal` ids) and both are covered by the sync-plane immutability guard
(`POSTED_DOCTYPES`). Fixture `0010-pos-and-delivery.json` pins the flows.

### UOM conversion at posting

Items in the registry upsert take an optional `stock_uom` plus a `uoms` list
(`[{uom, conversion_factor}]`, factor = stock units per one transaction
unit), matching the Dart `Item.uoms` / `UOM Conversion Detail` child table.
Submit lines may carry `uom`; when it differs from the item's stock UOM the
engine mirrors the Dart `uomFactor` + `_costStockMovements` semantics: the
SLE qty converts to stock units (`qty × factor`) so ledger, bins and the
negative-stock guard always track stock units, a plain receipt's rate divides
by the same factor (total stock value is preserved), issues cost in stock
units, and monetary line amounts stay exactly as sent. The SLE keeps the
transaction `uom` field (replicated too) for row parity with Dart; unknown
UOMs, unregistered items and missing `stock_uom` all default to factor 1.
Cancellation mirrors the stored (already converted) rows and never
re-converts. Fixture `0011-uom-conversion.json` pins the behaviour.

### Multi-currency base stamping

Documents may carry `currency` + `conversion_rate` (absent/non-positive ⇒ 1).
The Dart `_baseStampDocTypes` set applies — Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice
and Payment Entry (Journal Entry is not a posted doctype here yet): every
transaction-currency GL leg is stamped with `conversion_rate`,
`base_debit`/`base_credit` = amount × rate and `currency`; customer /
supplier subledger rows get `conversion_rate` + `base_amount`. Base amounts
are kept at **full precision** (never rounded per leg) so the base ledger
balances exactly like the transaction ledger. Tax and settlement rows stay in
transaction currency, and the invoice `outstanding_amount` is maintained in
transaction currency — both per the Dart engine. Stock valuation stays base
currency: stock GL legs always carry rate 1 with base == amount, and —
mirroring the Dart runtime, which does **not** convert incoming valuation —
a foreign-currency `update_stock` purchase costs its stock at the raw line
rate (the GRNI split leg is stamped at the document rate, exactly like the
Dart `_splitGrniFromExpense`). Reversals swap base columns with their
transaction columns. Fixture `0012-multicurrency-base-stamping.json` pins the
numbers; `tests/posting_replication.rs` pins the wire fields.

The one remaining deliberate Phase 3 bound (flagged in the plan as a later
refinement): no receipt↔invoice line-linkage variance posting (the
two-document flow clears GRNI at matching values). POS *session close*
remains Phase 6 client-side work — the POS Invoice posting itself is
supported here.

## Portal — customer / accountant links

The portal (`docs/NEURADIX_DOMAIN_AND_BRAND_ARCHITECTURE.md` §11) is served
under `portal.atlas.neuradix.app`; the paths below are host-agnostic and live
in this same binary (`src/portal.rs`).

### The `company_documents` read model

Drafts (quotations, unpaid-invoice metadata, customers, …) exist only as
mutations in the company log, so the portal renders from a **materialized
projection**: `(company_id, doctype, document_id)` → latest inner payload (the
row envelope's `payload`), child rows (`__children` → the `children` column),
docstatus and update time (`src/projection.rs`, table in `0003_portal.sql`).
Mutations fold in sync-version order with the client's semantics —
`createDocument`/`updateDocument`/`submitDocument`/`cancelDocument` upsert,
`deleteDocument` removes, a mutation without `__children` leaves stored
children intact. The projection is maintained **inside the same atomic step as
every log append** (client `sync/push` and the posting-commit replication path
share the stores' append), and `Store::rebuild_projection(company_id)` refolds
a company from scratch as a recovery/verification tool.

### Portal links (management plane, existing bearer auth)

Portal tokens are a **distinct token kind**: generated and stored hashed like
every other token but in their own `portal_links` table, so a portal token
never authenticates a member/device endpoint and member/device tokens 404 on
the portal plane.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/companies/{id}/portal-links` | **owner or admin** | `{kind: "customer"\|"accountant", party (required for customer), label, expires_days (default 90)}` → `{token, url_path, expiresAt}` |
| GET | `/companies/{id}/portal-links` | **owner or admin** | Link metadata + revoked state (tokens are never returned) |
| DELETE | `/companies/{id}/portal-links/{link_id}` | **owner or admin** | Revoke |

### Portal plane (the token in the path is the credential)

Unknown, expired and revoked tokens all read as **404**. Customer links are
scoped **strictly** to their customer: a document whose `customer` payload
field differs is a 404, never a 403 leak. `GET` endpoints on customer links
content-negotiate — `Accept: text/html` returns minimal server-rendered pages
(inline styles, no external assets, every interpolated value HTML-escaped);
JSON is the default.

| Method | Path | Link kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/portal/{token}` | customer | Summary: company name, customer id, open quotations (docstatus 0), unpaid invoices (submitted Sales Invoices with `outstanding_amount > 0`) |
| GET | `/portal/{token}/documents/{doctype}/{id}` | customer | Document payload + children (Quotation and Sales Invoice only) |
| POST | `/portal/{token}/quotations/{id}/accept` | customer | Appends a system mutation (device id `atlas-portal`, `updateDocument` row envelope) setting `accepted_on` to today; audit `portal.quote.accept`. Idempotent (repeat → 200, no new mutation); reject-after-accept → 409. HTML form posts redirect back to the document page |
| POST | `/portal/{token}/quotations/{id}/reject` | customer | Same, setting `rejected_on`; audit `portal.quote.reject`; accept-after-reject → 409 |
| GET | `/portal/{token}` | accountant | Summary: posted-document counts by doctype + GL entry count |
| GET | `/portal/{token}/gl.csv` | accountant | GL entries as CSV (`posting_date, voucher_type, voucher_no, account, debit, credit, party_type, party, is_reversal`), ordered by posting date then voucher |
| GET | `/portal/{token}/audit?limit=n` | accountant | Recent audit rows |

Payments are **not** part of the portal (that is the payment-links item;
invoice payment hands off to `pay.`, below).

## Payments — invoice pay links + Stripe webhook processing

Payment links (`docs/NEURADIX_DOMAIN_AND_BRAND_ARCHITECTURE.md` §12) are
served under `pay.atlas.neuradix.app`; the paths are host-agnostic and live in
this same binary (`src/pay.rs`).

### Pay links (management plane, existing bearer auth)

Pay tokens are a **distinct token kind** (their own `pay_links` table, hashed
at rest): a pay token never authenticates a member/device/portal endpoint and
other tokens never resolve on the pay plane.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/companies/{id}/pay-links` | **owner, admin, sales or accountant** | `{invoice_id, expires_days (default 60)}` → `{token, url_path: "/pay/{token}", expiresAt}`. The invoice must exist as a **submitted Sales Invoice** (posted document or read model), 404 otherwise |
| GET | `/companies/{id}/pay-links` | same roles | Link metadata + revoked state (tokens are never returned) |
| DELETE | `/companies/{id}/pay-links/{link_id}` | same roles | Revoke |

### Pay page (the token in the path is the credential)

`GET /pay/{token}` — no other auth; unknown, expired and revoked tokens all
read as **404**. JSON by default; `Accept: text/html` returns a minimal
server-rendered page (portal renderer pattern: inline styles, no external
assets, every interpolated value HTML-escaped). Both views carry the company
name, invoice id + official number, posting date, line items, grand total, the
**live outstanding amount** (from the posted document's payload, maintained by
the posting engine on every settlement) and the payment state — outstanding 0
renders "Paid — thank you".

### Card payments without outbound HTTP

The backend never calls Stripe. The owner creates a **Stripe Payment Link**
in the Stripe dashboard and stores its URL in the company settings
(`stripe_payment_link_url`, on the settings GET/PUT whitelist). The pay page's
"Pay by card" button links there with `?client_reference_id={token}` appended;
Stripe echoes `client_reference_id` back in its webhook, which is how a
payment finds its invoice — payment state flows exclusively through the
already-public webhook intake, so the backend needs no Stripe API key and no
egress. When `stripe_payment_link_url` is unset the page renders the company's
`payment_instructions` settings text (bank transfer details etc., also
whitelisted) instead.

### Stripe webhook processing (`POST /webhooks/payments/stripe`)

The webhook path is frozen under the `/webhooks/...` surface on
`connect.atlas.neuradix.app` (domain doc §9) — provider registrations never
change. Every delivery is intake-logged to `webhook_events` first (the durable
inbox), then:

- **Signature verification** per Stripe's scheme: the
  `Stripe-Signature: t=...,v1=...` header, where `v1` is the HMAC-SHA256 of
  `{t}.{raw body}` under the signing secret from the **`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  environment variable** (read once at startup). Comparison is constant-time;
  timestamps skewed more than 5 minutes are rejected with 400. With the
  variable unset the endpoint **fails closed**: 503 `webhook secret not
  configured`, logged, and no event is ever processed unverified.
- **`checkout.session.completed`** (and `payment_link.completed`-style
  payloads with the same fields): `data.object.client_reference_id` is the pay
  token, resolved to company + invoice; `amount_total` (cents) becomes
  `paid_amount`. The handler posts an **official Payment Entry** through the
  same posting engine as the command API — document id
  `PAY-STRIPE-{event id}`, `payment_type: Receive`, party = the invoice's
  customer, one reference allocating `min(paid, outstanding)` against the
  invoice — so settlement, outstanding maintenance, gap-free `PAY-…` numbering
  and device replication all come from the one `posting_commit` path; nothing
  is duplicated. Idempotency key `stripe-{event id}` makes Stripe redeliveries
  **replays**: the original response returns, nothing posts twice, no number
  is burnt.
- The posting is authored by the **payments system actor**: audit rows carry a
  null user (like portal-authored actions), and the replicated mutations carry
  device id **`atlas-payments`** (`src/pay.rs::PAYMENTS_DEVICE_ID`), alongside
  `atlas-backend` (posting replication) and `atlas-portal` (portal decisions).
- Business-level rejections — unknown/expired/revoked token, an invoice that
  is not an officially posted Sales Invoice, or zero outstanding — return
  **200 `{"handled": false, "reason": ...}`** so Stripe does not retry
  forever; the intake log row is kept and an audit row
  (`pay.webhook.rejected`) is written whenever a company is attributable.
  Other event types are logged and answered `handled: false` too.

**Why no outbound HTTP:** the whole payment loop is webhook-driven — the
backend publishes a static Payment Link URL and consumes signed callbacks. No
Stripe API key is stored, no egress is required (the deployment can keep a
deny-all outbound policy), there is no retry/timeout state against a third
party, and the only secret is the webhook signing secret, whose compromise
cannot move money — a forged event can at worst mark an invoice paid, and the
signature + idempotency + outstanding guards bound even that.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test          # 60 tests over MemStore (unit + API + fixtures + posting + replication + portal + payments); no DB required
```

Schema lives in `migrations/` (applied by `PgStore::connect` via embedded SQLx
migrations): `0001_init.sql` for the coordination plane (includes the
`mutations(company_id, sync_version)` index the pull path relies on),
`0002_postings.sql` for the posting authority (documents, numbering_series,
gl_entries, stock_ledger_entries, bins, settlements, posting_batches, items,
company_settings, idempotency_keys), `0003_portal.sql` for the portal
(portal_links, the company_documents read model), `0004_payments.sql` for
the payment plane (pay_links), `0005_subledgers.sql` for the customer /
supplier / tax subledger rows (party_transactions, tax_transactions),
`0006_sle_uom.sql` for the stock ledger's transaction-UOM column and
`0007_base_stamping.sql` for the GL multi-currency base columns.
